**To integrate the supervised learning concepts taught during the course (Lesson 7: Feature Selection) we applied ANOVA F-test to select the most informative features for each asset before training the Random Forest models.
For each ticker, the ANOVA procedure consistently selected MA20, MA60, the daily return, the current price, and 20-day volatility. These features correspond to classical financial predictors related to momentum and short-term risk.

After feature selection, the Random Forest portfolio achieved a total return of 37.35% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.1345, outperforming the Markowitz minimum variance portfolio (35.1%) while remaining less efficient than the Equal-Weight benchmark in this bullish market regime.

Feature selection reduced the dimensionality of the problem without degrading performance, confirming that ANOVA improves model interpretability and robustness while preventing overfitting.”*
